# REST API Tutorial

## Introduction
A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer) is a set of principles for designing web APIs. It allows clients to interact with server-side resources in a standardized way. REST APIs are widely used for building scalable and efficient web services.

## Key Concepts

### 1. HTTP Methods
REST API uses **HTTP methods** to define actions on resources:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server (read operation).
- **POST**: Send data to the server (create operation).
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource (update operation).
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server (delete operation).

### 2. JSON Representation
REST APIs use **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation) as the standard format for sending and receiving data between the client and server.

Example:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Product Name",
  "price": 29.99
}
```

### 3. Stateless Architecture
A REST API is **stateless**, meaning each request is treated independently. The server does not store any information about previous requests from the client, ensuring scalability and reliability.

### 4. Client-Server Model
In the **client-server model**, the client (frontend) sends requests to the server (backend), which processes the request and sends back a response. This separation of concerns allows the client and server to evolve independently.

### 5. Cacheable
REST APIs are **cacheable**, meaning responses can be cached by clients to improve performance. When a response is marked as cacheable, clients can reuse it instead of making repeated requests to the server.

### 6. Layered System
A REST API can use a **layered architecture**. This means there can be multiple intermediary layers (such as load balancers or proxies) between the client and the server, improving scalability and security without affecting the API's functionality.

### 7. Uniform Interface
A key principle of REST APIs is the **uniform interface**, which ensures that all requests and responses follow a consistent format. This makes the API easier to understand and use.

## Example Workflow

1. The client sends a **GET** request to retrieve a list of products.
2. The server responds with a **JSON** array of products.
3. The client sends a **POST** request to add a new product.
4. The server saves the new product and returns a **201 Created** status with the product data.
5. The client sends a **PUT** request to update the product details.
6. The server modifies the product and returns the updated resource.
7. The client sends a **DELETE** request to remove a product.
8. The server deletes the product and returns a **204 No Content** status.

## Conclusion
REST API is a widely-used standard for building web APIs that are scalable, maintainable, and easy to use. By adhering to principles like statelessness, a client-server model, and a uniform interface, developers can create APIs that are efficient and predictable.
