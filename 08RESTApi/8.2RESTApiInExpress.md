# Creating a REST API in Express

## Introduction

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building web and mobile applications. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to create a simple REST API in Express and explain some key practices and code snippets.

## Why Use `/api/users` Instead of `/users`

When building REST APIs, it is considered a good practice to prefix API routes with `/api`. This helps differentiate between routes that serve JSON data (for APIs) and routes that render HTML pages (for web pages). For example:
- `/users` might serve an HTML page with a list of users.
- `/api/users` will return the same list in **JSON format**, making it clear that this is an API endpoint.

This is especially useful when building applications that serve both web and mobile clients, as mobile apps typically expect JSON data from API endpoints, while web pages often render HTML.

## Example Code: Building a REST API in Express

```js
import express from 'express';
import users from './MOCK_DATA.json' assert { type: 'json' };

const app = express();
const PORT = 8000;
```

### Explanation:
- `express`: We import the `express` module to use its features to create routes and handle requests.
- `users`: A mock data file in JSON format is imported to simulate a database.
- `app`: We initialize the Express application and store it in the `app` constant.
- `PORT`: The server listens on port 8000.

### Home Route

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome to the Home Page!');
});
```

This route responds with a simple HTML message when the user accesses the root URL (`/`). It's a simple example of an HTML-rendering route.

### GET Request: Rendering an HTML Page

```js
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
    res.send('<h1>Users</h1>');
});
```

This route responds with an HTML heading when `/users` is visited. This route would typically be used to display an HTML page in a web application.

### GET Request: Returning All Users in JSON Format

```js
app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    res.send(users);
});
```

This API route responds with the full list of users in **JSON** format. Since it is prefixed with `/api`, it indicates that the client should expect JSON data.

### GET Request: Returning a Single User

```js
app.get('/api/users/:id', (req, res) => {
    const id = req.params.id;
    const user = users[id];
    res.send(user);
});
```

This route demonstrates dynamic routing using `:id`. When the user accesses `/api/users/:id` (e.g., `/api/users/1`), it returns the user data for the specified `id`.

### POST Request: Creating a New User

```js
app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    const newUser = req.body;
    users.push(newUser);
    res.send(newUser);
});
```

Here, we create a new user by handling a **POST** request. The new user's data is taken from the request body, added to the `users` array, and then returned in the response.

### PATCH and DELETE in a Single Route

```js
app.route('/api/users/:id')
    .get((req, res) => {
        const id = req.params.id;
        const user = users[id];
        res.send(user);
    })
    .patch((req, res) => {
        const id = req.params.id;
        const updatedUser = req.body;
        users[id] = updatedUser;
        res.send(updatedUser);
    })
    .delete((req, res) => {
        const id = req.params.id;
        users.splice(id, 1);
        res.send(users);
    });
```

Using `app.route()`, we handle multiple HTTP methods (GET, PATCH, DELETE) for the same `/api/users/:id` endpoint. This structure makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain:
- **GET**: Retrieves a single user by `id`.
- **PATCH**: Updates the user's data.
- **DELETE**: Removes the user from the list.

### Starting the Server

```js
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`));
```

This line starts the server on the specified port (8000 in this case). The callback function logs a message to the console once the server is up and running.

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a basic REST API example using Express. By prefixing API routes with `/api`, we differentiate between routes that serve JSON data for mobile clients and those that serve HTML for web clients. Additionally, Express makes it easy to handle multiple HTTP methods, dynamic routing, and CRUD operations with minimal code.
